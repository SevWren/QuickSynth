Issue: Incorrect Clipboard Formatting in System Prompt Bookmarklet

Description:
The current implementation of the system prompt bookmarklet copies text to the clipboard as a single line instead of preserving proper line breaks. This results in the copied content being difficult to read and process.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the bookmarklet on a page with articles.
2. Copy the generated text to the clipboard.
3. Paste the text into a text editor or document.
4. Observe that the content is copied as a single line with `\n` instead of actual line breaks.

Expected Behavior:
The copied text should preserve proper line breaks, making it readable and formatted correctly.

Actual Behavior:
The copied text appears as a single line with `\n` characters instead of proper line breaks.

Example of Incorrect Output:
```
Article Title - Example Title\nArticle Url - https://example.com\n\nArticle Title - Another Title\nArticle Url - https://anotherexample.com\n\n
```

Proposed Solution:
Update the bookmarklet to replace `\n` with actual line breaks (`\n` -> `\\n` in JavaScript) when generating the clipboard content.

Priority: High
